# PySpark-Modelling-with-Tiki-Vietnam

In every economy, e-commerce is a rapidly growing sector, with numerous factors influencing demand and sales quantity. This project deals with sales quantity in one of our South East Asian neighboring countries, Vietnam.

For this project, a modified version of Vietnamese e-retail transactions has been provided to build a Quantity Prediction Model. The model will be based on various typical transaction characteristics, using PySpark.

The file name is “ASG1_vietnamese_tiki_products_mod.csv,” containing a single table with 44,804 rows and 18 columns.

Your task is to load data from the CSV file for use in ASG1 and to build a simple machine learning model to predict the quantity sold for any given typical input of Vietnamese e-retail data.
